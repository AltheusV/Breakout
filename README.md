# Breakout

_Breakout_ is an arcade game developed and published by _Atari_, designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow.

In _Breakout_, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeated bouncing a ball off a paddle into them, without dropping the ball.

This is a project made in C on Windows, that I developed back in 2017 when I was learning about logic and imperative programming.
